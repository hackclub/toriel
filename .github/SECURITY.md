Please provide as much information as you can, including:
- Commit version (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) (if self-hosting)
- Step by step instructions on how to reproduce it
- Proof of concept (if possible)

We believe in the [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process) process.
