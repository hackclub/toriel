cave-intro: while wandering through the forest, you've stumbled down the entrance of a cave. it looks too high to climb back out.

cave-join: |
  oh hello... i don't think i recognize you; you must be new in town.
  you may call me <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>! i have tea and butterscotch pie cooling off... please come over.

  i just sent you a dm! you can tell by the :ping: to the left.

    hello, my child. please take some tea to calm your nerves.
    i must ask that you read this before proceeding:

    _TORIEL points to a page in a book laid out in front of you_
    > The tenants of the Slack (Abridged 12th ed.) Orpheus et al.

    > Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
    > Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
    > Don't advertise outside of <#${this.t('channels.present')}>.
    > Above all else, please follow the *<https://hackclub.com/conduct/#hacker-values|Hacker Values>*.

    _as you close the book, you see a link on its binding: https://conduct.hackclub.com._

    do you agree to abide by these terms?
  profile: |
    and with that â€” welcome to hack club, an incredible community of teenage programmers across the world! hack clubbers have shipped apps with millions of users, interviewed <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw3vyFZ4oeU|youtubers like 3blue1brown> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riru9OzScwk|builders like elon musk>, and work together every day to <https://github.com/hackclub/some-assembly-required|ship> <https://github.com/quackduck/devzat|projects> in some of the channels i'll add you to in a few minutes.

    your next step is to *fill out your slack profile*. you could:

    - link your website
    - link your github, gitlab or sourcehut
    - list some of your interests
    - set your profile picture

    to do this, click on your profile picture here, then click _Profile_:

  club-leader: |
    are you joining the slack because you're either currently running or considering running a hack club at your school?

    (it's ok if not â€”Â this is so i can direct you to the right channels)
  added-to-channels: |
    i've now added you to some channels you might like. feel free to explore â€”Â but if you don't know where to start, perhaps you'll find one of my suggestions useful:

  <@${this.user}> (${this.hs ? 'a high schooler' : 'an adult'} in ${this.continent.toLowerCase()}) just became a full user in the Slack! Here's why they joined:
  ${this.message.split('\n').map(line => '> '+line)}

      You only wanted to say hello...? Well then.
      'Hello!'
      I hope that suffices. Hee hee.
    - |
      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You wanted to say hello again?
      'Salutations!'
      Is that enough?
    - |
      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      I should have given you some <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.wordle')}|games> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}|to> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.uno-games')}|play>.
      My apologies.
      Why not user your imagination to divert yourself?

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      I should have given <https://hackclub.github.io/reading-list/|a book> to you.
      My apologies.

      Hello, my child.
      Sorry, I do not have much to say.
      It was nice to hear your voice, though.
    - |
      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You want to know more about me?
      Well, I am afraid there is not much to say.
      I am just a silly little lady who wants to help everyone!

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      We could paint the walls at my house ${this.t('themes.array')}
      Or, if you prefer another color, you can find one for yourself in <#${this.t('channels.slack-themes')}>
    - |
      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      We could catch snails in the garden later.
      They make a wonderful pie.
