announcements-to-cave: hello wanderer! head to <#${this.t('channels.cave')}> to continue your journey.

cave-intro: |
  while wandering through the forest, you stumble down the entrance of a cave. it looks too high to climb back out.

cave-ping: |
  _you hear a faint :ping: from the darkness._

cave-join: |
  oh hello... i don't think i recognize you; you must be new in town.
  you may call me <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>! i have tea and a fresh ${this.t('type-of-pie')} pie cooling off... please come over.

  i just sent you a dm! you can tell by the :ping: to the left.

    friend, please enjoy the tea and pie while you read this.

    _they point to a page in a book in front of you._ â€œThe Tenants of the Hack Club Slack (abridged 14th ed.), Orpheus et al.

    <https://hackclub.com/conduct/#hacker-values|README>
    

    Handwritten in the margins, it says
    Be kind, thoughtful and no advertisements.

    _Toriel leans in._ "Do you vow to uphold the hacker values?"

    We also care about your safety. Email problems or concerns to our confidential moderation team (made up primarily of teens!) : conduct@hackclub.com

  club-leader: |
    are you joining the slack because you're either currently running or considering running a hack club at your school?

    (it's ok if not â€” this is so i can direct you to the right channels)
  added-to-channels: |
    And with that, youâ€™re now a full fledged member of the Hack Club online community!

    _You hear the echoes of so many voices and you get a sense of a vast system of cave tunnels and channels and rooms that permeate the darkness. You feel your heart rate increase, just a little. Toriel smiles and refills your tea._

    Perhaps I can point out a few of my favorite places?

    <#${this.t('channels.announcements')}> to hear big news.

    <#${this.t('channels.happenings')}> to help guide your way

    <#${this.t('channels.ship')}> to be amazed by people just like you

    *Most importantly, you must introduce yourself in <#${this.t('channels.welcome')}>. There are so many intrepid travelers like yourself and they're so excited to meet you.*
  added-to-channels-epoch: |
    <https://hack.af/epoch-banner|welcome!> we're so excited to have you here for epoch; *to confirm your registration for epoch, head to <#${this.t('channels.epoch')}> and say hi!*

    iâ€™ve also added you to some other channels you might like. feel free to poke around and get your fellow hackers!

      You only wanted to say hello...? Well then.
      'Hello!'
      I hope that suffices. Hee hee.

      You wanted to say hello again?
      'Salutations!'
      Is that enough?

      Are you bored?
      I should have given you some <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.wordle')}|games> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}|to> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.uno-games')}|play>.
      My apologies.
      Why not user your imagination to divert yourself?

      Hello, my child.
      Sorry, I do not have much to say.
      It was nice to hear your voice, though.

      ðŸ“ž This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You want to know more about me?
      Well, I am afraid there is not much to say.
      I am just a silly little lady who wants to help everyone!

      Are you bored?
      We could paint the walls at my house ${this.t('themes.array')}
      Or, if you prefer another color, you can find one for yourself in <#${this.t('channels.slack-themes')}>

      Are you bored?
      We could catch snails in the garden later.
      They make a wonderful pie.
