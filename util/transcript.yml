cave-intro: while wandering through the forest, you've stumbled down the entrance of a cave. it looks too high to climb back out.

cave-join: |
  oh hello... i don't think i recognize you; you must be new in town.
  you may call me <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>! i have tea and butterscotch pie cooling off... please come over.

  i just sent you a dm! you can tell by the :ping: to the left.

    hello, my child. please take some tea to calm your nerves.
    i must ask that you read this before gaining access to the rest of the slack:

    _TORIEL points to a page in a book laid out in front of you_
    > The tenants of the Hack Club Slack (Abridged 12th ed.) Orpheus et al.

    > Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
    > Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
    > Don't advertise outside of \`#​present\`.
    > Above all else, please follow the *<https://hackclub.com/conduct/#hacker-values|Hacker Values>*.

    _as you close the book, you see a link on its binding: https://conduct.hackclub.com._

    do you agree to abide by the code of conduct?
  profile: |
    and with that — welcome to hack club, an incredible community of teenage programmers across the world!

    your next step is to *fill out your slack profile*. you could:

    - link your website
    - link your github, gitlab or sourcehut
    - list some of your interests
    - set your profile picture

    to do this, click on your profile picture in the upper right, then click _Profile_:

    are you joining the slack because you're either currently running or considering running a hack club at your school?

    (it's ok if not — this is so i can direct you to the right channels)
  added-to-channels: |
    i’ve now added you to some channels you might like; feel free to poke around. here’s an overview if you feel lost or overwhelmed:

    <#${this.t('channels.announcements')}> <#${this.t('channels.community')}> <#${this.t('channels.hq')}> are the places where new activities and events are announced

    <#${this.t('channels.scrapbook')}> <#${this.t('channels.ship')}> are the places to see what hack clubbers are making and to showcase your own projects

    to meet hack clubbers running hackathons and get help running your own: <#${this.t('channels.hackathon-organizers')}>

    active hack club projects you can check out or help build:
    • we’re building <https://sinerider.hackclub.dev|sinerider>, a game about love and graphing, at <#${this.t('channels.gamedev')}>
    • we’re giving scrapbook new life at <#${this.t('channels.scrapbook-dev')}>
    • <#${this.t('channels.sprig')}>: get a free game console by <https://sprig.hackclub.com|making a fun game>

    to see the channels people are currently talking in, send \`/bunny\` as a message in any channel
    
    also, feel free to post an introduction in <#${this.t('channels.welcome')}> (don't worry, this is totally optional)!

    if that’s still too much, perhaps you’ll find one of my suggestions useful:

    > ${this.suggestion}
  added-to-channels-epoch: |
    <https://hack.af/epoch-banner|welcome!> we're so excited to have you here for epoch; *to confirm your registration for epoch, head to <#${this.t('channels.epoch')}> and say hi!*
    
    i’ve also added you to some other channels you might like. feel free to poke around and get your fellow hackers!

      You only wanted to say hello...? Well then.
      'Hello!'
      I hope that suffices. Hee hee.

      📞 This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You wanted to say hello again?
      'Salutations!'
      Is that enough?

      📞 This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      I should have given you some <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.wordle')}|games> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.whack-a-mole')}|to> <https://hackclub.slack.com/messages/${this.t('channels.uno-games')}|play>.
      My apologies.
      Why not user your imagination to divert yourself?

      Hello, my child.
      Sorry, I do not have much to say.
      It was nice to hear your voice, though.
    - |
      📞 This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      You want to know more about me?
      Well, I am afraid there is not much to say.
      I am just a silly little lady who wants to help everyone!

      📞 This is <@${this.t('selfUserID')}>.
      Are you bored?
      We could paint the walls at my house ${this.t('themes.array')}
      Or, if you prefer another color, you can find one for yourself in <#${this.t('channels.slack-themes')}>

      Are you bored?
      We could catch snails in the garden later.
      They make a wonderful pie.
